he has been on a journey of investing in people and communities\n          in Uganda, first in Luweero shortly after the civil war (1982 – 1986) where\n          he founded a church hospital, Kiwoko Hospital, which still stands to this day\n          providing community and curative services at very low cost. It has one of the best\n          neonatal intensive care units in Uganda.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"sub-text\">\n          Later Ian and Robbie moved to Kampala where he set up International Hospital\n          and International Medical Centres. Subsequently he founded Clarke International\n          University, while his son Sean founded Clarke Junior School. These projects were\n          for development in the health and education sector. More recently he invested in\n          agriculture in Clarke Farm. The agricultural sector in Uganda supports 80% of the\n          population, so if one can bring improvements in this sector it has a significant effect\n          on household incomes of a large
